# Lesson 1: Introduction to HTML

## What is HTML?

HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.

## Basic HTML Structure

Every HTML document has a basic structure:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My First Web Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Common HTML Elements

- `<h1>` to `<h6>`: Headings
- `<p>`: Paragraph
- `<a>`: Anchor (link)
- `<img>`: Image
- `<ul>` and `<li>`: Unordered list and list items

## Your First Project

Let's create a simple blog page about your favorite hobby. For example, if you like soccer, you could write about the latest match you watched.

### Steps

1. Open a text editor (like VS Code).
2. Create a new file called `index.html`.
3. Copy the basic HTML structure above.
4. Change the title to "My Soccer Blog".
5. Add a heading with your blog's name.
6. Write a paragraph describing your favorite team.

## Example: My First Blog

Here's an example of what your HTML might look like:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Soccer Blog</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Soccer Blog!</h1>
    <p>Today I watched an amazing match between Barcelona and Real Madrid.</p>
    <p>The final score was 2-1. What a game!</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Next Steps

In the next lesson, we'll learn about CSS and how to style your page.
